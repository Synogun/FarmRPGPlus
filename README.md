## ü§îüí≠ Considerations

> X. Cheating may be subject to an immediate ban.\
> (A) Do not use any form of botting, scripting, macros, etc. Just don‚Äôt. While FarmRPG is non-competitive, using any sort of hardware device, script, bot, macro, etc to play the game in an automated fashion is strictly forbidden. Do not discuss this topic in any public forum within the FarmRPG platform. Automation in the game causes a large amount of server requests and bandwidth usage that can impact game play for the entire community.

The userscript strictly follows the game's [Code Of Conduct](https://farmrpg.com/#!/coc.php), therefore, not automating or performing any actions in place of the player.

This userscript its not an official part of the Farm RPG.\
*Magic & Wires LLC.* are not responsible in any way for the errors introduced by this userscript and along with the game staff should not be bother in any way about it, for contact refer to [section above](#-farmrpg-plus).

## üíæ About data saved

The script saves data in the browser's local storage, which is not shared between devices or browsers.\
This means that if you switch browsers or devices, your data will not be carried over.

All data saved is related to the script's features and settings, such as:
- Features enabled/disabled
- Settings for each feature
- Cached data for performance improvements

Know that the script does not save any personal data, such as your FarmRPG account information or any other sensitive data.

### If any script feature seems broken, try resetting the it's data by going to the settings page and clicking on "Reset FarmRPG Plus Data". This will clear all saved data and restore the script to its default state.
